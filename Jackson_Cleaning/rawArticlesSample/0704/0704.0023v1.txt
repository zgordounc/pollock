 ALMA as the ideal probe of the solar chromosphere

 Abstract The very nature of the solar chromosphere,
 its structuring and dynamics, remains far from being
 properly understood, in spite of intensive research. Here
 we point out the potential of chromospheric observa-
 tions at millimeter wavelengths to resolve this long-
 standing problem. Computations carried out with a so-
 phisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere
 due to Carlsson and Stein demonstrate that millimeter
 emission is extremely sensitive to dynamic processes in
 the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to
 look for dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0
 mm. The model also suggests that high resolution ob-
 servations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by
 ALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to
 both the hot and the cool gas, and thus will have the
 potential of distinguishing between rival models of the
 solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from
 the observations of the quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the
 BIMA array (resolution of 12â€²â€²) reveal signiï¬cant oscil-
 lations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of
 1.5-8 mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscil-
 lations in internetwork and longer periods in network
 regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that
 provided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation
 between the features within the solar atmosphere and

 1 Introduction
 The chromosphere remains the least understood layer of
 the solar atmosphere, with the very basics of its struc-
 ture being hotly debated: is it better described by the
 classical picture of a steady temperature rise as a func-
 tion of height, with superposed weak oscillations (e.g.
 semi empirical models of Vernazza et al. [8], Fontenla
 et al. [5]), or does the temperature keep dropping out-
 wards, with very hot shocks producing strong localized
 heating (radiation hydrodynamic simulations of Carls-
 son & Stein [3], [4], and Wedemeyer et al. [9])? The
 latter concept is consistent with the IR observations of
 carbon monoxide, which require cool gas to be present
 at chromospheric heights (see, e.g. Ayres [1]).
 Thus, existing models cannot provide a complete de-
 scription of the solar chromosphere. Consequently now-
 adays two alternative pictures of the chromosphere co-
 exist and the role played by chromospheric dynamics in
 the structuring of this atmospheric layer is a subject of
 intense scientiï¬c debate.
 One reason for conï¬‚icting models is that they are
 based either on atomic chromospheric lines and con-
 tinua in the UV or on molecular lines in the IR, since
 UV observations are practically blind to cool gas in a
 dynamic chromosphere, while the IR observations sam-
 ple only the cool part of the chromosphere. Improved
 and more sensitive diagnostics of the chromospheric
 structure and dynamics, that sample both the hot and2

 the cool gas and should distinguish between the ri-
 val models, are provided by observations at millime-
 ter wavelengths with an acceptable spatial resolution
 as was proposed by Loukitcheva et al. [6]. In this con-
 tribution we review the unique chromospheric obser-
 vations at 3 .5 mm with the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland
 Array and the analysis of the intensity variations ex-
 pected from the model of Carlsson & Stein for mm
 wavelengths. We postulate the requirements for mm ob-
 servations with the future instruments, with emphasis
 on spatial and temporal resolution. Finally we discuss
 the prospects for chromospheric studies with ALMA.
 2 Results
 2.1 Analysis of the BIMA observations at 3.5 mm
 The Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Array (BIMA) operat-
 ing at a wavelength of 3.5 mm (frequency of 85 GHz)has been the only interferometer in the mm range fre-
 quently used for solar observations. The BIMA tele-
 scopes are now part of the CARMA array which will
 also carry out such observations. With the BIMA data
 obtained in the years 2003 and 2004 we have constructed
 two-dimensional maps of the solar chromosphere with a
 resolution of 12â€²â€², which represents the highest spatial
 resolution achieved so far at this wavelength for non-
 ï¬‚are solar observations. The BIMA images have led
 to new insights in to chromospheric structure and to
 the detection of spatially-resolved chromospheric oscil-
 lations at mm wavelengths. The details of the restora-
 tion procedure and extensive tests of the sensitivity of
 the BIMA data to the detection of dynamic signatures
 can be found in White et al. [11].
 With the currently available resolution the contrast
 of the brightness structures is evaluated to be up to
 30% of the quiet-sun brightness at 3.5 mm (White et
 al. [11]). However, the similarity of brightness struc-3
 tures, derived from the mm images and seen in other
 chromospheric emissions (Fig.1), in spite of the diï¬€er-
 ence in resolution of the images (1-2â€²â€²resolution of the
 UV images), implies that the BIMA resolution is not
 enough to resolve the millimeter ï¬ne structure and ob-
 servations with spatial resolution much higher than 12â€²â€²
 are required. A detailed analysis of the relations be-
 tween the millimeter emission, magnetic ï¬eld and other
 chromospheric diagnostics is in preparation.
 In the millimeter brightness we detected intensity
 oscillations with typical amplitudes of 50-150 K in the
 range of periods from 120 to 700 seconds (frequency
 range 1.5-8 mHz). We found a tendency toward short
 period oscillations in internetwork and longer periods in
 network regions in the quiet Sun, which is in good agree-
 ment with the results obtained at other wavelengths. At
 3 mm the inner parts of the chromospheric cells exhibit
 a behavior typical of the internetwork with the maxi-
 mum of the Fourier power in the 3-minute range, how-
 ever, most of the oscillations are quasi-periodic, show-
 ing up in wave trains of ï¬nite duration lasting for typi-
 cally 1-3 wave periods (see also Loukitcheva et al. [7]).
 2.2 Analysis of the CS model millimeter spectrum
 The response of the submillimeter and millimeter ra-
 diation to a time-series generated by Carlsson & Stein
 (CS) was computed under the assumption of thermal
 free-free radiation by Loukitcheva et al. [6]. The results
 are depicted in Fig. 2 as the excess intensity as a func-
 tion of wavelength and time.

 trum with time. Negative grey scale representing excess int ensity

 Wave periods of approximately 3 min can be clearly
 distinguished in the intensity at all considered wave-
 lengths. Though the dominant frequency of the oscilla-
 tions changes slightly with wavelength, for all mm wave-
 lengths it lies in the range of 3 minutes. The diï¬€erence
 from one period of time to another can be explained
 by the presence of merging shocks during certain time
 intervals. The diï¬€erences in the light curves at diï¬€er-ent wavelengths are caused primarily by the diï¬€erence
 in the formation heights of the emitted radiation. In
 general the amplitudes of the oscillations compared to
 the radiation temperature are large, in this sense mm
 wavelength radiation combines the advantages of the
 CO lines, which mainly see the cool gas, with those of
 atomic lines and UV continua, which mainly sample the
 hot gas.
 On the whole, the brightness temperatures are ex-
 tremely time-dependent at millimeter wavelengths, fol-
 lowing changes in the atmospheric parameters. With
 increasing wavelength the amplitude of the brightness
 oscillations grows signiï¬cantly, reaches its maximum
 value at 2.2 mm (expected to be 15% of the quiet-Sun
 brightness temperature), and decreases rapidly towards
 longer wavelengths. Thus we can identify the range 0.8-
 5.0 mm as the appropriate range of mm wavelengths at
 which one can expect the clearest signatures of dynamic
 eï¬€ects. A careful look at the mm brightness spectrum
 as a function of time (see Fig. 2) reveals a time delay
 between the oscillations at long and short millimeter
 wavelengths. Hence, it is possible to study wave modes
 traveling in the chromosphere by comparing sub-mm
 with mm observations.
 3 Discussion
 The CS model predicts that spatially and temporally
 resolved observations should clearly exhibit the signa-
 tures of the strong shock waves. However, a direct com-
 parison of the observational data products (RMS val-
 ues, histogram skewness, Fourier and wavelet spectra,
 etc.), referring to regions with weak magnetic ï¬eld like
 the quiet Sun internetwork, with the corresponding prod-
 ucts expected from the simulations of Carlsson & Stein
 exhibits large diï¬€erences. In particular, the RMS of the
 brightness temperature is nearly an order of magnitude
 larger in the model (800 K at 3 mm) than in the ob-
 servations (100 K). Another diï¬€erence is the absence of
 longer periods in the model power spectrum. But these
 discrepancies do not rule out the CS models. On the
 one hand the model is one dimensional and hence does
 not predict a coherence length of the oscillations, while
 on the other hand we are not able to resolve individual
 oscillating elements due to the limited spatial resolution
 of the observations.
 Consequently we estimated the inï¬‚uence of the spa-
 tial smearing on the model parameters of chromospheric
 dynamics and on the observed oscillatory power. Thus
 we conï¬rmed that the very limited spatial resolution
 currently available hinders a clean separation between
 cells and network and typically both network and in-
 ternetwork areas contribute to the recorded BIMA ra-4
 diation. From the analysis of the observational data it
 was found that power in all frequency ranges increases
 signiï¬cantly with improving resolution. Consistency be-
 tween the power predicted by the CS model and the
 observed power is obtained if the coherence length of
 oscillating elements is on the order of 1â€²â€².
 Our results are consistent with Wedemeyer et al.
 [10], who computed the millimeter wave signature re-
 sulting from the 3-D simulations of Wedemeyer et al.
 [9]. Although the 3-D simulations suï¬€er from the fact
 that the radiative transfer of energy is computed en-
 tirely in LTE, which becomes a poor assumption at
 chromospheric heights, the authors believe that the chro-
 mospheric pattern and its temporal evolution is repre-
 sentative of the non-magnetic internetwork regions of
 the solar chromosphere. The simulations display a com-
 plex 3D structure of the chromospheric layers, which is
 highly dynamical on temporal scales of 20-25 s and on
 spatial scales comparable to solar granulation, which is
 in good agreement with the 1â€²â€²size of oscillating ele-
 ments that we deduced. According to Wedemeyer et al.
 [9] the chromospheric temperature structure is charac-
 terized by a pattern of hot shock waves, which originate
 from convective motions, and cool gas lying between the
 shocks. The intensity distribution at mm wavelengths
 follows the pattern of the shocks in the chromosphere
 with a sub arcsecond size of the features associated with
 the shocks. All this complex and dynamic 3D structure
 can be deduced from observations at mm wavelengths
 with a suï¬ƒciently high spatial resolution of better than
 1â€²â€².
 4 Summary
 Simultaneous mm-submm observations at diï¬€erent wave-
 lengths can be used for the tomography of the solar
 atmosphere, as radiation at the diï¬€erent wavelengths
 originates from diï¬€erent layers, with the average for-
 mation height increasing with wavelength. Such obser-
 vations also provide a strong test of present and future
 models. However, observations that might be able to
 uncover the nature of the chromosphere should meet
 the following requirements:
 â€“multiband observations in mm-submm domain (0.8-
 5.0 mm) to address shock waves and chromospheric
 oscillation modes
 â€“arcsecond spatial resolution to resolve ï¬ne structure
 â€“temporal resolution better than a few seconds to
 follow its evolution in time
 â€“FOV size of order of 1â€²
 â€“accurate absolute calibration of the observations (Bas-
 tian [2])These requirements look very similar to the techni-
 cal speciï¬cation of the continuum observations with the
 Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), which rep-
 resents an enormous advance over existing instrumenta-
 tion operating at mm-submm wavelengths. ALMA will
 produce images of the highest resolution available for
 the foreseeable future (although the technical problem
 of sampling both large and small spatial scales simulta-
 neously, required for highâ€“quality imaging of the chro-
 mosphere, will remain a challenge) and will be the most
 sensitive instrument operating at submm-mm wavelengths.
 To summarize, ALMA will be an extraordinarily pow-
 erful instrument for studying the solar chromosphere. It
 will ï¬nally allow the mapping of the three-dimensional
 thermal structure of the solar chromosphere which will
 be a real breakthrough in solar studies.
